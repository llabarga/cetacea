# Species distribution visualisation project

Animals are moving living things and knowing how they move and how they distribute is really important. With climate change and habitat degradation distribution and migration are changing. Habitats that were suitable for species, aren't anymore, either because the forest where the monkey lived has dissapeared or  the temperature where a bird lived has risen too much.

Maps are basic tools that help us see where the animals are or have been. To learn about making maps in R I made this simple interactive map of some species of cetacea made with data from GBIF (2025).
